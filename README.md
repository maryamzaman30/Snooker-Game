For my midterm project in Semester 4, I developed a physics-driven Snooker Game using JavaScript with p5.js and the matter.js physics engine, simulating realistic ball dynamics and interactive gameplay. The game supports multiple initialization modes triggered by key inputs—from standard starting positions to randomized layouts with red or colored balls, enhancing replayability and control over game scenarios. I also introduced an experimental “gravity pockets” mode, where invisible forces attract or repel balls, adding unpredictability and expanding the game’s complexity. Designed and implemented independently, the project emphasized hands-on application of physics simulation, collision handling, and was accompanied by a video commentary and report detailing its mechanics and creative process.
