## Graphics Programming - Snooker Game

I developed a physics-driven Snooker Game using JavaScript with p5.js and the matter.js physics engine, simulating realistic ball dynamics and interactive gameplay. The game supports multiple initialization modes triggered by key inputs, with starting positions (keystroke "1"), random positions with reds only (keystroke "2"), and random positions with reds and colored balls (keystroke "3"), excluding the cue ball, enhancing replayability and control over game scenarios. I also implemented an extension mode (keystroke "4") with gravity pockets, where invisible forces attract or repel balls, adding unpredictability and expanding the gameâ€™s complexity. Designed and implemented independently, the project emphasized hands-on application of physics simulation, collision handling and object-oriented, and was accompanied by a video commentary and report detailing its mechanics and creative process.
